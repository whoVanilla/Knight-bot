**Knight bot** is a discord bot written in **JavaScript** for testing or personal use only. It's currently under development and I am still adding new commands and features everyday. Join my [**discord**](https://discord.gg/eM93FsUJpa)  if you have any question, want to use the bot or run into any issue.


> **Happy coding!**
